<p class="t0">No price is set on the lavish summer;</p>
<p class="t0">June may be had by the poorest comer.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And what is so rare as a day in June?</p>
<p class="t">Then, if ever, come perfect days;</p>
<p class="t0">Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,</p>
<p class="t">And over it softly her warm ear lays:</p>
<p class="t0">Whether we look, or whether we listen,</p>
<p class="t0">We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;</p>
<p class="t0">Every clod feels a stir of might,</p>
<p class="t">An instinct within it that reaches and towers,</p>
<p class="t0">And, groping blindly above it for light,</p>
<p class="t">Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;</p>
<p class="t0">The flush of life may well be seen</p>
<p class="t">Thrilling back over hills and valleys;</p>
<p class="t0">The cowslip startles in meadows green,</p>
<p class="t">The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,</p>
<p class="t0">And there&rsquo;s never a leaf nor a blade too mean</p>
<p class="t">To be some happy creature&rsquo;s palace;</p>
<p class="t0">The little bird sits at his door in the sun,</p>
<p class="t">Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,</p>
<p class="t0">And lets his illumined being o&rsquo;errun</p>
<p class="t">With the deluge of summer it receives;</p>
<p class="t0">His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,</p>

<h2 id="c2">BULLOCK&rsquo;S ORIOLE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Icterus bullocki.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Bullock&rsquo;s Oriole, a species as handsome
and conspicuous as the Baltimore Oriole,
replaces it in the western portions of the
United States and is likewise widely distributed.
Its breeding range within our
borders corresponds to its distribution.
It is only a summer resident with us, arriving
usually from its winter haunts in
Mexico during the last half of March and,
moving slowly northward, reaches the
more northern parts of its breeding range
from a month to six weeks later. It appears
to be much rarer in the immediate
vicinity of the seacoast than in the Great
Basin regions, where it is common nearly
everywhere, especially if sufficient water
is found to support a few stunted cottonwoods
and willows. During my extensive
wanderings through nearly all the states
west of the Rocky Mountains and extending
from the Mexican to the British borders,
I have met with this species almost
everywhere in the lowlands and in some
localities have found it very abundant.
Like the Baltimore Oriole, it avoids
densely wooded regions and the higher
mountains. It is especially abundant in
the rolling prairie country traversed
here and there by small streams having
their sources in some of the many minor
mountain ranges which are such prominent
features of the landscape in portions
of Idaho, Washington and Oregon. These
streams are fringed with groves of cottonwood,
mixed with birch, willow and alder
bushes, which are the favorite resorts of
this Oriole during the breeding season.
The immediate vicinity of water is, however,
not considered absolutely necessary,
as I have found it nesting fully a mile or
more away from it on hillsides, the edges
of table-lands and in isolated trees, or
even in bushes. In Colorado it is said to
be found at altitudes of over eight thousand
feet, but as a rule it prefers much
lower elevations.</p>
<p>The call notes of Bullock&rsquo;s Oriole are
very similar to those of the Baltimore, but
its song is neither as pleasing to the ear
nor as clear and melodious as that of the
latter. Its food is similar and consists
principally of insects and a few wild berries.</p>
<p>The nest resembles that of the Baltimore
Oriole, but as a rule it is not quite
as pensile and many are more or less
securely fastened by the sides as well as
by the rim to some of the adjoining
twigs. The general make-up is similar.
As many of the sections where Bullock&rsquo;s
Oriole breeds are still rather sparsely settled,
less twine and such other material
as may be picked up about human habitations
enter into its composition. Shreds
of wild flax and other fiber-bearing plants
and the inner bark of the juniper and willow
are more extensively utilized; these
with horsehair and the down of plants,
wool and fine moss furnish the inner lining
of the nests. According to my observations,
the birch, alder, cottonwood, eucalyptus,
willow, sycamore, oak, pine and
juniper furnish the favorite nesting sites;
and in Southern Arizona and Western
Texas it builds frequently in bunches of
mistletoe growing on cottonwood and
mesquite trees.</p>
<p>The nests are usually placed in low situation,
from six to fifteen feet from the
ground, but occasionally one is found
fully fifty feet up. A very handsome nest,
now before me, is placed among six twigs
of mistletoe, several of these being incorporated
in the sides of the nest, which is
woven entirely of horsehair and white
cotton thread, making a very pretty combination.
The bottom of the nest is lined
with wool.</p>

<p>The sexes are extremely devoted to
each other and valiantly defend their eggs
and young. I once saw a pair vigorously
attack a Richardson&rsquo;s squirrel, which evidently
was intent on mischief, and drive
it out of the tree in which they had their
nest. Both birds acted with the greatest
courage and dashed at it repeatedly with
fury, the squirrel beating a hasty retreat
from the combined attack. The young
are large enough to leave the nest in about
two weeks and are diligently guarded and
cared for by both parents until able to
provide for themselves.</p>

<p>From &ldquo;Life Histories of North American Birds.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3">AN AFTERNOON IN THE CORNFIELD.</h2>
<p>Uncle Philip was 16 years old, tall and
strong, with merry dark eyes, red cheeks
and thick, soft, wavy, brown hair. Every
day except Saturday he was in school.
Sometimes on Saturdays he went in the
woods botanizing or he rowed his pretty
boat, &ldquo;The Lorelei,&rdquo; upon the lake. But,
often he went to his sister&rsquo;s, Mamma
Bryant&rsquo;s, to spend the day and work
upon the farm. His little nephew, Leicester,
was always glad when he came,
for Uncle Philip took him with him to
the field or barn, told him funny stories
and taught him to take notice of all the
things he saw or heard. One beautiful
day in October, after the corn had been
all cut and was standing in big yellow
stooks, making long rows through the
stubble, Uncle Philip arrived early in
the morning at Leicester&rsquo;s home. Leicester
was still in bed when Uncle Philip
came, and Mamma Bryant said to herself,
&ldquo;I must go and see if he is awake.&rdquo;
But just as she was about to open the
door, out came Leicester in his white
pajamas, rubbing his eyes and looking a
little bit sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Leicester,&rdquo; said his mamma, &ldquo;I
will help you dress and then you can have
your breakfast. Uncle Philip has been
here and he has gone to the cornfield
south of the meadow. He hitched up
Blotter and Little Gray on the new wagon
and will drive back to dinner. Come with
me and get ready for breakfast. After
breakfast I want you to take little sister
Keren with you and hunt for the eggs.
If you are a good, pleasant boy this
morning you may go this afternoon with
uncle, and I will make some cookies for
you to take in your lunch basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leicester, who was generally a very
good boy, promised to do as his mother
desired.</p>
<p>Before dinner time Aunt Dorothy
came, and it was decided that she, too,
should go to the cornfield and take Keren
with her.</p>
<p>By one o&rsquo;clock dinner was over. Mamma
Bryant had decided that Leicester&rsquo;s
lunch basket was too small, so she had
taken a peach basket, into which she put,
among other good things to eat, some
large red apples and ever so many fresh
baked cookies.</p>
<p>Uncle Philip had driven up the roadway
and was standing in the new wagon
waiting for his passengers. Corn huskers
never take a seat on their wagons,
but Uncle Philip had laid a board across
the wagon-box and on that Aunt Dorothy
seated herself.</p>
<p>It was a warm, bright day and the
wagon ride to the cornfield was delightful.
Blotter and Little Gray were not a
very handsome team, but they were good
gentle horses and the children loved
them. Blotter was a white horse with
black spots on him, which made him look
as if he had been used for a pen-wiper.</p>
<p>On the way to the cornfield a little
rabbit ran out of the bushes by the roadside,
but quickly hid himself again. The
chipmunks stood on their hind feet in
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the tall, withered grass and watched the
new wagon coming down the road and
popped into their holes when they
thought it had come too near. The plumy
pappus of the golden rod, with great
bunches of scarlet rose seeds, bursting
pods of the satin plant and clusters of
large red and chocolate oak leaves growing
on year-old sprouts which had sprung
up from the stumps of trees cut down the
fall before made huge bouquets in the
fence corners. While driving through
the meadow the horses, which were pastured
there, came up to neigh a good-day
to their friends in the harness and trotted
along for some time on both sides of
the wagon and behind it. At last the
cornfield was reached and Uncle Philip
drove up to a corn stook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that bird sitting on the wire
fence,&rdquo; said Aunt Dorothy. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
a butcher bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Uncle Philip, &ldquo;that is a
shrike, or butcher bird. I should not
wonder if it were the same bird that followed
me around this morning. I won&rsquo;t
tell you what he did, but if you will
watch him maybe you&rsquo;ll see something
very interesting yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Philip put on his husking gloves
and began his work, taking the ears of
corn from the stalks in the stook without
disturbing it any more than he could
help.</p>
<p>Aunt Dorothy remained sitting on her
board in the wagon.</p>
<p>Leicester and Keren went to play in
the meadow through which they had
just driven, and they frightened the
butcher bird so that he flew away from
the fence and perched near the top of a
tall cornstalk in a neighboring stook.
Keren found a dandelion blossom and
Leicester a wild rose, a bit of pale, pink
beauty that had blossomed late and alone
on a bush whose leaves were dusty and
faded. The children went to a hickory
tree expecting to find some nuts on the
ground, but the squirrels had been there
already and nothing was left except some
nut-shells. Yes, there were three or four
nuts, but when, by the aid of two stones,
the children had cracked them, they
found the meat inside all dried up and
unfit to eat. The squirrels must have
known this without cracking the nuts,
otherwise they would not have left them
as they did.</p>
<p>Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Philip were
talking about the butcher bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The butcher bird is found all over
the world,&rdquo; said Aunt Dorothy, &ldquo;and has
different names in different countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it has been written about by men
who lived a long, long time ago,&rdquo; said
Uncle Philip, and he told Aunt Dorothy
some of those men&rsquo;s names. But they
are so long and hard to say I will not
tell them here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shrike is a cousin to the crow.
Nearly all the crows have black feathers,
but the butcher bird wears a different
dress in France from the one he
wears in England, and in India he has
still another garb,&rdquo; said Aunt Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Uncle Philip, &ldquo;but all the
shrikes everywhere have toothed bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time two more shrikes or
butcher birds had joined the first one
and all three were flying about impatiently
from place to place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as if they were waiting for something
to happen,&rdquo; said Aunt Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; said Uncle Philip, who
had finished husking the corn in his
stook. &ldquo;Call the children now; or I
will,&rdquo; he said, and whistled and beckoned
till Leicester and Keren came running to
where he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;look at that stunted
old tree over there, children. Do you
see the three butcher birds in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, every one saw the birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get into the
wagon and keep watch of them. I am
going to drive to the next corn stook,&rdquo;
and away they went. After Uncle Philip
had stopped the horses he told Aunt
Dorothy and the children to sit together
on the board with their backs to the
horses and keep very still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going behind the corn stook and
will pull it away as best I can from where
it now stands. Watch the birds and the
ground near the stook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he had pulled away the
cornstalks he stooped down and walked
away some distance as quickly and quietly
as he could. Then Aunt Dorothy
and the children saw the butcher birds
alight on the ground on which the cornstalks
had been and catch young mice
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and moles. One of the birds took a mole
to the wire fence near by and stuck it
on a barb. Then he flew away, leaving
it hanging there. He was going to catch
some young mice to eat just then and
save the mole for luncheon.</p>
<p>His claws were not strong enough to
hold the mole while he could kill and eat
it, but if he hung it on the wire fence
he could use all his strength in tearing
it to pieces with his strong toothed bill.
Every one felt sorry for the poor mole,
but all were glad to be able to see how
the butcher bird gets his dinner.</p>
<p>Time went by and soon Uncle Philip
was ready to move another bunch of cornstalks.
Aunt Dorothy and the children
prepared to watch again, for the butcher
birds were still in the neighborhood and
waiting anxiously for a chance to secure
some more prey. This time there was a
rat under the cornstalks and a bold
butcher bird flew at him and tried to kill
him. The rat, however, got away from
his enemy in feathers. One of the
butcher birds caught a mole and stuck it
on a long thorn on a hawthorn tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have something to eat as well
as the birds,&rdquo; said Uncle Philip. So he
left Blotter and Little Gray standing in
the field&mdash;they were never known to run
away&mdash;and all went to a pleasant spot in
the meadow and ate the luncheon which
Mama Bryant had sent in the peach basket.
Oh, how good those cookies tasted
to Leicester and Keren!</p>
<p>Those were happy passengers who
rode home that evening on the yellow
ears of corn. Keren had found one red
ear and she took it home and gave it a
place by the side of her pet playthings.</p>
<p>At supper time Leicester told his papa
what they had seen the butcher birds do,
and Aunt Dorothy said: &ldquo;You must tell
about it in school, Leicester; it will make
a good Monday morning story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening after Uncle Philip and
Aunt Dorothy had gone home and the
children had said their little evening
prayer Leicester kissed his mother and
told her he would try to be a good boy
every day for a whole week. &ldquo;And I
hope I will have as good a time next
Saturday as I have had to-day,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>And all night long the little stars peeping
through the windows saw two happy
little faces asleep upon their pillows.</p>

<p>This little shore or beach bird is sometimes
called the White or Surf Snipe, and
the Ruddy Plover. It breeds only in the
colder portions of the northern hemisphere
and migrates southward, even beyond
the equator where it makes its home
during the winter months. It frequents
chiefly those regions near the surf-beaten
shores of the oceans. It is also a common
visitor to the beaches of larger inland
waters. On these shores its beautiful
form and habits are very noticeable. It
walks and runs in a dignified and graceful
manner as it chases the receding water
searching for its food.</p>
<p>The pure white of the plumage of the
under parts of the bird is a striking characteristic
as they reflect the sunlight during
flight. It is a silent bird and it sometimes
appears alone, though it is usually
seen in flocks and is frequently associated
with other species of the snipe family.
Regarding its habits, some one has said:
&ldquo;When feeding along the extreme verge
of the ocean it is pleasant to watch its
active movements when advancing or retreating
with the influx of the sea. It is
naturally very unwary and regards man
with less suspicion than most of our
snipes. When a flock is fired into, those
which survive rise with a low whistling
note, perform a few evolutions and presently
resume their occupation with as
much confidence as previously exhibited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The feet of the Sanderling are unlike
the other members of its family, being
without a fourth toe, entirely divided and
without a membrane. This indicates that
it frequents firm surfaces and that it is
fitted for running and walking upon the
long, shelving beaches over which the
tides and surf roll, leaving an abundance
of its particular food.</p>
<p>The nest of the Sanderling, rudely
constructed of dried grass and decayed
leaves, is placed in a depression in the
ground so situated as to be protected by
the natural vegetation of the region. The
eggs, usually three or four in number,
have an ashy or greenish brown ground
color and are finely spotted with different
shades of brown.</p>
<p>The food of the Sanderling consists
mainly of sea worms, small bivalve shells
and crustaceans, though it will also eat
buds and insects. It would seem as if its
hunger was never satiated&mdash;always busy,
always moving. These expressions describe
its habits, as with its fellows and
the other snipes with which it associates,
it seeks its food in the wake of the retreating
wave and turning, runs before the incoming
water which seldom engulfs it.</p>
<p>For those who are so fortunate as to be
located near the feeding grounds there
can be no more interesting recreation than
to sit on the beach and watch the peculiar
antics of these delicate creatures. Frequently,
without an apparent reason an
entire flock will rise as if in answer to a
signal and, after executing a few turns
alight, again resume the occupation it
had left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c7">PARTNERS.</h2>
<p>No doubt every one knows the Lichens,
the greenish gray growths, sometimes
like rosettes or clusters of leaves
or of fruit, on tree trunks or the gray
rocks by the water, and even on the
ground and old wood. Their forms are
various and often graceful, and mingled
with their greenish gray are many
brighter colors, giving a rich tone to the
rough surfaces they cover and adorn.
But I dare say that most of us have
thought of a Lichen as a single plant. It
is not so, though it looks so exactly like
one in its close union. It is a partnership,
indeed; generally what looks like a single
Lichen is a colony of partners keeping
house together, or a manufacturing
firm, if you like that expression of their
business better. The partners are also
kindred, or were so, in the past.</p>
<p>For there was a time long ago when
there was only one big family of plants,
the Algae; the brown Algae or seaweeds
known as kelps often form the
&ldquo;wrack&rdquo; or tangle of weeds like long
leaves or branching stems, with berry or
fruit-like bladders, thrown on the coast in
great masses by a storm; and the red Algae,
or the beautiful fern-like and coral-like
seaweeds that grow far down in the
deep sea. There are also the green Algae,
found in fresh water, or even on
damp tree trunks and rocks. They have
many odd forms. One kind, called a pond
scum, is a frothy, slippery mass of
spirally wound bands, floating in ponds
or still water; another, called &ldquo;green
felt,&rdquo; is found in water also, and has egg-like
things from which spores or seed-like
bodies escape to form new plants.
They have filaments at the bottom, like
roots, that are called &ldquo;holdfasts.&rdquo; Lastly,
there are blue-green Algae, jelly-like
masses found on trees, rocks, damp earth
or floating as green slimes in fresh water.
Most water plants are active and independent.
They are on the upward road,
for though they have not distinct stems,
roots, leaves or fruit, their different
parts, as I have already said, show a decided
likeness to these, especially their
&ldquo;holdfasts&rdquo; to roots and their air-bladders
to fruit. The exquisite red seaweeds
are as graceful in form and vivid
in color as many flowers.</p>
<p>There is a remarkable foreshadowing
of the moral law even among these early
growths. Some have shirked their work,
which was to absorb waste substances,
and manufacture these into organized
plant food. They tried to live on other
growths, to the injury of the latter, and
even sank to feeding on dead substances.
They lost the green chlorophyll, which is
necessary for manufacturing, though the
red and brown Algae do not show its
presence because their other coloring is
more vivid. But it is present all the
same with every busy, self-respecting
plant. The lazy, pauper growths deteriorated
more and more and at last were
no longer Algae at all, but Fungi. They
could not live by themselves; their only
chance was to get active or well-stocked
partners. As the Alga developed more
and more into a likeness of a perfect
plant, so the Fungus grew less like one.
The white furry &ldquo;mould&rdquo; on bread or
preserved fruit, the &ldquo;mildew&rdquo; on grapes
and lilac leaves, the &ldquo;black knot&rdquo; of
cherry and plum, the &ldquo;ergot&rdquo; of rye, the
&ldquo;rust&rdquo; of wheat, do not look like plants
unless you study them through a magnifying
glass. Nor do the &ldquo;slime moulds&rdquo;
or the mushrooms, toadstools, puff-balls
and truffles bear much resemblance to
flowers. Some of these, however, are
both pretty and useful.</p>
<p>In the case of a Lichen the partners
really seem to be of use to each other.
The Fungus is not a mere pauper living
on his more active kinsman. If you examine
a Lichen you will find a large number
of transparent threads, and in their
meshes lie the green Algae, giving the
whole a greenish tint. The little cups or
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
discs of the Fungus that appear on the
surface are lined with vivid colors, and
have delicate little bags or sacs, with
seed-like spores inside. The Fungus supplies
a shelter from extreme cold, and
also holds water in which the Algae finds
raw material. It is like a man and wife
housekeeping, the man providing the
house and the raw stuff&mdash;flour, eggs,
sugar, etc.&mdash;and the wife makes these
materials into food. Plants, by aid of
their green stuff, work over the carbon
and other materials they get from air
and water and make sugar and starch,
or organized food. This is their manufacture
and they must have an abundance
of light to do it well, so when the
sea Algae grow to be immense kelps or
seaweed, hundreds of feet long, they are
kept afloat by their air bladders. Now,
it is true the Fungus in our Lichen
could not live at all without its busy
Algae, which it holds in its transparent
filaments, but it is not a useless partner,
so we will not call it evil names. I think
you will be surprised to hear, after all
the warning given by these dependent
and generally worthless idlers in the
plant world, some of the beautiful and
blooming flowers have fallen into their
bad habits and are regular underground
thieves.</p>
<p>For the Gerardia or false foxglove
has established no partnership; it is plain
stealing. It still works, so it has not lost
its green of the leaf, or the purple and
gold of its flower, but it steals the materials
for its work. When it becomes
utterly idle and useless it will lose all its
color and be like the ghostly white Indian
pipes that grow in the shadowy
pine woods.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know how it steals.
In the dark basement chambers underground
the root servants of the plant
move slowly in a certain circle that corresponds
to the circle of light that the
branches describe overhead. Within this
space they gather chemicals from the soil
and store up moisture, sending these by
the sap up their elevators to the well-lighted
leaves, where the manufacturing
of starch and sugar goes busily on. Now,
the Gerardia, being too trifling to collect
its own stuff, sends suckers into the roots
of other plants and greedily absorbs their
contents. That is the reason it is so hard
to transplant the Gerardia&mdash;its roots are
enmeshed and entangled so in other
roots below ground. A very odd thing
sometimes happens to it. In the dark
the roots occasionally blunder and tap
other roots of the same Gerardia, just as
if a pickpocket in the dark were by mistake
to put his hand slyly into his own
pocket and steal his own purse.</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE GREAT NORTHERN SHRIKE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Lanius borealis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Of the great family Laniidae, the
shrikes, of the order Passeres, we have in
America only two species, the Great
Northern Shrike, Lanius borealis, and
the loggerhead shrike, which has been
dealt with in a previous article. The
name of the Great Northern Shrike
is much more than a mouthful, and is all
out of proportion to the size and importance
of the bird, though when I intimate
it lacks in importance I by no means wish
to say that it lacks in interest.</p>
<p>There are two hundred species of
shrikes altogether, nearly all of them being
confined to the Old World. When
one comes to know fully the characteristics
of the creatures he feels that the birds
would not have been out of place if they
had been classed in the order Raptores,
because they possess the distinguishing
traits of the bird of prey. The shrikes,
however, do not have talons, and they are
singers of no mean order, facts which
perhaps disqualify them for association
with their larger rapacious brethren.</p>
<p>The Great Northern Shrike, more commonly
perhaps called Butcher Bird,
comes from northern British-American
territory to the latitude of Chicago in the
fall and stays through the winter, when
it leaves for the vicinity of Fort Anderson
in the crown territories, to build its
nest. This is placed in a low tree or
bush and is composed of twigs and
grasses. The eggs number four or five.
During the winter the shrike&rsquo;s food consists
almost entirely of small birds, with
an occasional mouse to add variety. In
the summer its diet is made up chiefly of
the larger insects, though at times a small
snake is caught and eaten with apparent
relish.</p>
<p>The Great Northern Shrike has the
habit of impaling the bodies of its victims
upon thorns or of hanging them by the
neck in the crotch of two small limbs. The
bird has a peculiar flight, hard to describe,
but which, when seen a few times,
impresses itself so upon the memory
vision that it can never afterward be mistaken,
even though seen at a long distance.
The Great Northern&rsquo;s favorite
perch is the very tiptop of a tree, from
which it can survey the surrounding
country and mark out its victims with its
keen eye. In taking its perch the shrike
flies until one gets the impression that it
is to light in the very heart of the tree.
Then it suddenly changes direction and
shoots upward almost perpendicularly to
its favorite watch tower.</p>
<p>The Great Northern Shrike is larger
and darker than its brother, the loggerhead.
It is also a much better singer,
its notes being varied and almost entirely
musical, though occasionally it perpetrates
a sort of a harsh half croak that
ruins the performance. In general appearance
at some little distance the shrike
is not unlike a mocking bird. The description
here given for the adult answers
for both male and female: Upper parts
gray; wings and tail black; primaries
white at the base, secondaries tipped with
white or grayish; outer, sometimes all
the tail feathers, tipped with white, the
outer feathers mostly white; forehead
whitish; lores grayish black; ear coverts
black; under parts white, generally finely
barred with black; bill hooked and hawk-like.
Immature bird similar, but entire
plumage more or less heavily barred or
washed with grayish brown.</p>
<p>One has to have something of the
savage in him to enjoy thoroughly the
study of the shrike. As a matter of fact,
the close daily observance of the bird involves
some little sacrifice for the person
whose nature is tempered with mercy.
The shrike is essentially cruel. It is a
butcher pure and simple and a butcher
that knows no merciful methods in plying
its trade. More than this, the shrike
is the most arrant hypocrite in the whole
bird calendar. Its appearance as it sits
apparently sunning itself, but in reality
keeping sharp lookout for prey, is the
perfect counterfeit of innocence. The
Great Northern Shrike is no mean vocalist.
Its notes are alluringly gentle, and,
to paraphrase a somewhat famous quotation,
&ldquo;It sings and sings and is a villain
still.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>There is one compensation beyond the
general interest of the thing for the student
who has to endure the sight of the
sufferings of the shrike&rsquo;s victims in order
to get an adequate idea of its conduct of
life. The redeeming thing is found in
the fact that in the winter time the great
majority of the shrike&rsquo;s victims are the
pestilential English sparrows, whom
every bird lover would be willing to see
sacrificed to make a shrike&rsquo;s supper,
though he might regret the attending
pain pangs.</p>
<p>My own observations of the shrike
have been limited to the city of Chicago
and to the fields immediately beyond its
walls. For those unfamiliar with the
subject it may be best to say that in the
winter season the shrike is abundant in
the parks of the great smoky city by the
lake, and not infrequently it invades the
pulsing business heart of the town. No
one ever saw the placidity of the shrike
disturbed in the least. It will perch on
the top of a small tree and never move
so much as a feather, barring its tail,
which is in well nigh constant motion,
when the clanging electric cars rush by
or when the passing wagons shake its
perch to the foundation.</p>
<p>The Great Northern Shrike reaches the
city from its habitat beyond the Canada
line about the first of November. For
four years in succession I saw my first
Northern Shrike of the season on November
first, a day set down in the
Church Calendar for the commemoration
of &ldquo;All Saints.&rdquo; It is eminently in keeping
with the hypocritical character of
Mr. Shrike, sinner that he is, to put in
an appearance on so holy a day. From
the time of his coming until late March
and sometimes well into April, the shrike
remains an urban resident and harries
the sparrow tribe to its heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>As far as my own observation goes the
Great Northern Shrike in winter does
not put very much food in cold storage.
I have never seen many victims of the
bird&rsquo;s rapacity impaled upon thorns. Perhaps
I should qualify this statement a bit
by saying that I have never seen many
victims hanging up in one place. I have
watched carefully something like a score
of the birds, and while every one occasionally
hung up one of its victims, there
was nothing approaching the &ldquo;general
storehouse&rdquo; of food, so often described.
It is my belief that this habit of impaling
its prey upon thorns or of hanging it by
the neck in a crotch is one that is confined
largely to the summer season, and
especially to the nesting period.</p>
<p>The Great Northern Shrike has been
said by some writers to be a bully as well
as a butcher. I have never seen any evidence
of this trait in his character. He
does not seem to care for what some
small human souls consider the delight
of cowing weaker vessels. When the
shrike gives chase to its feathered quarry
it gives chase for the sole purpose of obtaining
food. While the bird is not a
bully in the sense in which I have written,
it displays at times the cruelty of a fiend.
It has apparently something of the cat
in its nature. It delights to play with its
prey after it has been seized, and by one
swift stroke reduce it to a state of helplessness.</p>
<p>Every morning during the month of
February, 1898, a shrike came to a tree
directly in front of my window on Pearson
street, in Chicago. The locality
abounded in sparrows and it was for that
reason the shrike was such a constant
visitor. The bird paid no attention to
the faces at the window, and made its
excursions for victims in plain view. The
shrike is not the most skilled hunter in
the world. About three out of four of his
quests are bootless, but as he makes many
of them he never lacks for a meal. The
Pearson street shrike one day rounded
the corner of the building on its way to
its favorite perch, and encountering a
sparrow midway struck it down in full
flight. The shrike carried its struggling
victim to the usual tree. There it drilled
a hole in the sparrow&rsquo;s skull and then
allowed the suffering, quivering creature
to fall toward the ground. The butcher
followed with a swoop much like that of
a hawk and, catching its prey once more,
bore it aloft and then dropped it again
as it seemed for the very enjoyment of
witnessing suffering. Finally when the
sparrow had fallen for the third time it
reached the ground before the shrike
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
could reseize it. The victim had strength
enough to flutter into a small hole in a
snow bank, where it was hidden from
sight. The shrike made no attempt to
recapture the sparrow. It seemingly was
a pure case of &ldquo;out of sight, out of
mind.&rdquo; In a few moments it flew away
in search of another victim. The sparrow
was picked up from the snow bank
and put out of its misery, for it was still
living. There was a hole in its skull as
round as though it had been punched
with a conductor&rsquo;s ticket clip.</p>
<p>It has been my experience that the
Great Northern Shrike hunts most successfully
when he, so to speak, flies down
his prey. If he gets a small bird well
started out into the open and with cover
at a long distance ahead, the shrike generally
manages to overtake and overpower
his victim. If the quarry, however,
is sought in the underbrush or in
the close twined branches of the treetop,
it generally succeeds in eluding the
butcher. One of the most interesting incidents
of all my bird observations was
that of the attempted capture by a Great
Northern Shrike of a small brown creeper.
The scene of the action was near
the south end of the Lincoln Park lagoon
in Chicago. The creeper was nimbly
climbing a tree hole, industriously picking
out insects, as is his custom, when a
shrike dropped down after him from its
high perch on a tree which stood close
and overshadowed the one from whose
bark the creeper was gleaning its breakfast.
The shrike was seen coming. The
creeper, for the fraction of a second, flattened
itself and clung convulsively to
the tree trunk. Then, recovering, it
darted to the other side of the hole, while
the shrike brought up abruptly and clumsily
just at the spot where the creeper
had been. The discomfited bird went
back to its perch. The creeper rounded
the tree once more and down went the
shrike. The tactics of a moment before
were repeated, the shrike going back to
its perch chagrined and empty clawed.
Five times it made the attempt to capture
the creeper, and every time the little
bird eluded its enemy by a quick retreat.
It was a veritable game of hide
and seek, amusing and interesting for the
spectator, but to the birds a game of life
and death. Life won. I ever have believed
thoroughly that the creeper
thought out the problem of escape for
itself. The last time the shrike went
back to its perch the creeper did not show
round the trunk again, but instead flew
away, keeping the hole of the tree between
itself and its foe. It reached a
place of safety unseen. The shrike
watched for the quarry to reappear. In
a few moments it grew impatient and
flew down and completely circled the
tree. Then, seemingly knowing that it
had been fooled, it left the place in disgust.</p>
<p>Of the boldness of the Great Northern
Shrike there can be no question. It allows
man to approach within a few feet
and looks him in the eye with a certain
haughty defiance, showing no trace of
nervousness, save the flirting of his tail,
which is a characteristic of the bird and
in no way attributable to fear or uneasiness.
One morning early in March, when
the migration had just started, I saw two
shrikes on the grass in the very center
of the ball ground at the south end of
Lincoln Park. They were engaged in a
pitched battle, and went for each other
much after the manner of game cocks.
The feathers literally flew. I looked at
them through a powerful field glass and
saw a small dark object on the grass at
the very point of their fighting. Then I
knew that the battle was being waged for
the possession of an unfortunate bird
victim. The birds kept up the fight for
fully two minutes. Then, being anxious
to find out just what the dead bird was
which had given rise to the row, I walked
rapidly toward the combatants. They
paid no heed to me until I was within
twenty feet of the scene of their encounter.
Then they flew away. I kept my
eyes on the much ruffled body of the little
victim lying on the grass and, walking
toward it, I stooped over to pick it
up. At that instant, as quick as the passing
of light, one of the shrikes darted
under my hand, seized the quarry and
made off with it. It was an exhibition
of boldness that did not fail to win admiration.
I did not have the chance to learn
what bird it was that had fallen a
victim to the shrikes&rsquo; rapacity and had
been the cause of that battle royal.</p>
<p>The Great Northern Shrike when it
is attempting to capture a mouse, or a
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
small bird that has taken refuge in a
bush, hovers over the quarry almost precisely
after the manner of the sparrow
hawk. There are few more fascinating
sights in nature than that of the bird with
its body absolutely motionless, but with
its wings moving with the rapidity of the
blades of an electric fan. Sharply outlined
against the sky, it fixes the attention
and rouses an interest that leaves little
room for sympathy with the intended
victim that one knows is cowering below.
A mouse in the open has little
chance for escape from the clutches of
the hovering shrike. Birds, however,
which have wisdom enough to stay in the
bush and trust to its shelter rather than
to launch out into open flight, are more
than apt to escape with their lives. In
February last I saw two shrike-pursued
English sparrows take to the cover of a
vine-covered lilac shrub. They sought
a place well near the roots. While flying
they had shown every symptom of fear
and were making a better pace than I
had ever seen one of their tribe make before.
The shrike brought itself up
sharply in midair directly over the lilac,
and there it hovered on light wing and
looked longingly downward through the
interlacing stems at the sparrows. It
paid no heed to its human observer, who
was standing within a few feet and who,
to his amazement, saw an utter absence
of any appearance of fear on the part of
the sparrows. They apparently knew that;
the shrike could not strike them down
because of the intervening branches.
They must have known also that owing
to the comparative clumsiness of their
pursuer when making its way on foot
through and along twigs and limbs, that
they could easily elude him if he made
an attempt at capture after that manner.
Finally the shrike forsook the tip of the
lilac bush and began working its way
downward along the outer edge of the
shrub. When it had approached to a
point as near as the sparrows thought
was comfortable, they shifted their position
in the bush. The shrike saw that
the quest was useless unless he could
start them to flight. He tried it, but they
were too cunning for him, and he at last
gave up the chase, the progress of which
actually seemed to humiliate him. He
flew afar off, where, perhaps, the prospects
of dinner were better.</p>
<p>I once saw a goldfinch in winter plumage
escape a Great Northern Shrike by
taking a flight directly at the zenith. The
shrike followed the dainty little tidbit far
up, until the larger bird was only a speck
and the little one had disappeared entirely.
The shrike apparently could
neither stand the pace nor the altitude,
and the watchers, with whom the goldfinch
was the favorite in the race, rejoiced
with the winner.</p>

<p class="lr">&mdash;James Russell Lowell, &ldquo;Under the Willows.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c11">THE FIRE-BIRD.</h2>
<p>This Oriole is one of the most brilliantly
colored of our common birds. The
name oriole is from &ldquo;aureolus,&rdquo; meaning,
little bird in gold. Ruskin says that
on the plumes of birds the gold of the
cloud is put, that cannot be gathered of
any covetousness.</p>
<p>There is a story to the effect that when,
in 1628, Lord Baltimore was exploring
the Chesapeake, worn out and discouraged,
he was so much cheered by the
sight and sound of the oriole that he
adopted its colors as his own, hence the
name, &ldquo;Baltimore Oriole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bird, however, rejoices in several
other cognomens, such as English Robin,
Golden Robin, Hang-nest Bird, Fire-Finch,
and Golden Oriole. He is both
esthetic and utilitarian, being beautiful,
musical, social and also useful in that he
feeds upon insects most injurious to vegetation;
especially the harmful small kinds
passed over unnoticed by the birds of
other species.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Oriole is fond of sweets.
He has been seen to snip off the heads of
white-headed or stingless bees and draw
out the viscera through the ring-like
opening, for the sake of the honey sack.
How did he know it was there? How did
he learn that he could get at it in this
way? The poet naturalist, Thompson,
well says of him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;You whisk wild splendors through the trees,</p>
<p class="t">And send keen fervors down the wind;</p>
<p class="t0">You singe the jackets of the bees,</p>
<p class="t">And trail an opal mist behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When flowery hints foresay the berry,</p>
<p class="t">On spray of haw and tuft of briar,</p>
<p class="t0">Then wandering incendiary,</p>
<p class="t">You set the maple swamps afire.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>While the Oriole&rsquo;s song is not especially
melodious to me, it is fresh and
cheerful, with something of a human element
in its child-like whistle. Young
birds in the nest cry &ldquo;cree-te-te-te-te-te.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bird is fond of building near the
habitations of men, selecting sites in door-yards,
orchards, and lawns. He weaves
an artistic habitation at airy heights,
choosing strong, flexible material for the
pendant, bag-like nest. In California, the
Arizona hooded oriole weaves nests of
the beautiful Spanish moss; but one occasionally
uses the love-vine or yellow
dodder to construct a gaudy, pocket-like
nest. The Fire-bird would not do this,
for it always selects for its nest grayish,
bleached material in harmony with
the limbs of the trees. An experiment
was tried of placing a bunch of colored
yarns near its nesting-place, in order to
see what, if it used them, the choice of
colors would be. It selected all the gray
threads, and, when nearly done, a few
blue and purple, but not a single red, or
green or yellow strand. The strongest
and best material is used for the part by
which the whole is supported.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Oriole is sometimes on
intimate terms with his relative, the Orchard
Oriole. Last summer the latter
had hung its pretty cup-shaped nest on
a branch of weeping willow near my window.
The tedium of her sitting was relieved
several times by a morning call
from Sir Baltimore. He would seat himself
on a twig near her nest and utter a
soft, clear note, which no doubt meant a
greeting in bird language. When he went
away a few moments later, his two notes
sounded strangely like &ldquo;A&mdash;dieu&rdquo;&mdash;a
translation for which Olive Thorn Miller
is authority.</p>
<p>But his song and his speech were less
heeded than the spectacle of his brilliant
flight&mdash;</p>

<h2 id="c12">BRANDT&rsquo;S CORMORANT.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Phalacrocorax penicillatus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>There are about thirty species of Cormorants
which are distributed throughout
the world. Ten of these are known to
inhabit North America. They are ocean
birds, yet they are also occasionally seen
on the larger bodies of fresh water. The
Pacific coast of North America and the
shores of New Zealand are rich in species
and their plumage is more beautiful than
that of those found in other parts of the
world.</p>
<p>The name Cormorant is derived from
the Latin words Corvus Marinus, meaning
marine crow or raven. This name
may have been suggested by the fact that
these birds are fond of sitting on an elevated
perch, especially after a hearty
meal. In this habit of seeking high
perches, and because of their dark color,
they resemble the raven or crow. The
generic name Phalacrocorax is derived
from the Greek words, meaning bald
crow.</p>
<p>One of the species that frequents the
coast of Europe is easily tamed and in
early times was trained to fish for its
master. There was even an appointment
in the royal household known as the
&ldquo;Master of the Cormorants.&rdquo; When used
in fishing &ldquo;a strap is fastened around the
bird&rsquo;s neck so as, without impeding its
breath, to hinder it from swallowing its
captures. Arrived at the waterside, it is
cast off. It at once dives and darts along
the bottom as swiftly as an arrow in quest
of its prey, rapidly scanning every hole
or pool. A fish is generally seized within
a few seconds of its being sighted and as
each is taken the bird rises to the surface
with its capture in its bill. It does not
take much longer to dispose of the prize in
the dilatable skin of its throat so far as
the strap will allow and the pursuit is recommenced
until the bird&rsquo;s gular pouch,
capacious as it is, will hold no more. It
then returns to its keeper, who has been
anxiously watching and encouraging its
movements, and a little manipulation of
its neck effects the delivery of the booty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cormorants are voracious eaters.
They catch the fish, which is their usual
food, under water by rapid swimming and
with the aid of their hooked bills. On account
of this habit of the bird the word
Cormorant has been used synonymously
with the word glutton, rapacious or avaricious
when applied to a person who
exhibits these traits.</p>
<p>Brandt&rsquo;s Cormorant, the bird of our illustration,
is found on the Pacific coast
from the state of Washington southward
to Cape St. Lucas at the southern extremity
of Lower California. In its habits it is
gregarious and collects in great numbers
wherever its natural food of fish is plentiful.
These flocks present a very odd appearance
and their long necks appear as
numerous black sticks on the watery background.</p>
<p>Mr. Leverett M. Loomis well illustrates
the habits of these birds in a report on
the California Water birds. He says of
a rookery &ldquo;which is situated on a rock,
or little islet, in the ocean at the extremity
of Point Carmel, about fifteen yards from
the mainland. This rock rises perpendicularly
some forty or more feet above the
water. At first sight it does not seem that
it can be scaled, but closer inspection reveals
that a foothold may be had in the
seams and protuberances on its water-worn
sides. Only on days when the sea
is very calm can the rock be landed upon
and then only from the sheltered channel
separating it from the mainland. We first
took a view of the rookery from the mainland.
The Cormorants were very tame,
remaining on their nests while we clambered
down the sloping rocks and while
we stood watching them on the same
level, only a few yards away. They were
equally tame when our boat drew nearer
as we approached from the water. The
clefts in the sides of the rock were occupied
by Baird&rsquo;s Cormorant and the top by
Brandt&rsquo;s. There were comparatively few
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
of the former, but of the Brandt&rsquo;s Cormorant
there were upwards of two hundred
pairs. Their nests covered the top
of the rock, every available situation being
occupied. Standing in one place I counted
one hundred and eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also states that the Cormorants remained
on the nests till he fired his gun
and they lingered on the edge of the
rock while he walked among the nests a
few yards away. On the rock were many
piles of sardines, evidently placed near the
nests for the use of the sitting bird.</p>
<p>The nests are nearly circular when
placed on top of the rocks, and are usually
constructed of eel grass. They are
generally placed in the most inaccessible
places and at various heights above
the surface of the water. The Cormorants
frequent the same locality from
year to year and experience considerable
difficulty in constructing their nests because
of the gulls which frequently carry
away the material as fast as it can be
gathered. The young, when first hatched,
are entirely devoid of plumage and their
skin resembles a &ldquo;greasy, black kid
glove.&rdquo; It is said that the gulls feed upon
these young birds.</p>
<p>Mr. Frank M. Woodruff relates the following
observations, made during a recent
trip to California. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Brandt&rsquo;s Cormorant is the common
species wintering in Southern California.
Like the California brown pelican
and the surf ducks, only the juvenile birds
are found in the bay close to the city of
San Diego. As one rows about the harbor
close to the shipping docks and by the
old deserted fishermen&rsquo;s huts along the
slips, large numbers of Brandt&rsquo;s Cormorants
and pelicans can be seen perched on
and almost covering the sunny sides of
the roof tops. They sit in rows like sentinels
with the head well down upon the
shoulders, undisturbed by the noise of
traffic and only by continued rapping on
the building with an oar can they be induced
to take to flight. They will usually
circle for a short time in a lazy manner
and then return to their old position. The
older birds are rather more wary and
usually feed a mile or so from the shore,
in flocks of from three to ten. The loose
kelp floating in the bay attracts the smaller
fish. Such places form their feeding
grounds. After they become gorged with
fish, they fly to the rocks along the jetties
and to the cross bars of the buoys, which
mark the deep water channels. The birds
are perfect gluttons, and as I lifted it into
the boat there dropped from the gular
sack of one specimen that I shot, over
twenty small fish. The beautiful iridescence
of the dark copper-green plumage
of the adult Cormorant can only be appreciated
when the freshly killed bird is
seen.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c13">MATE, OR PARAGUAY TEA.</h2>
<p>It is a trite saying, but a very true one,
that one-half the world does not know
how the other half lives. This will apply
to food and drink, as well as to other
things, so widely do customs vary in
different regions.</p>
<p>While tea, coffee and chocolate, all
products of warm climates, have come
into general use as table drinks over the
greater portion of the globe, so as to be
universally known, there is a beverage of
similar use, the favorite of millions,
which is practically unknown to the world
at large.</p>
<p>Mate (two syllables) is the name of
the prepared leaves of a shrub or tree
belonging to the Rhamses family, and
has the scientific name of Cassine gonhonha,
but is more generally known as
Ilex paraguayensis, as it was first used
by the Indians of Paraguay. It belongs
to the natural order of the holly, to which
it bears much resemblance. Its leaves
are six to eight inches long, short stalked,
oblong, wedge-shaped, and finely toothed
at the margin. The small white flowers
are borne in clusters at the axils of the
leaves. It bears a four-seeded berry, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the leaves are used for decoction, except
for a very fine quality, which is made
from the dried flower buds.</p>
<p>It abounds in the forests of Paraguay
and Brazil, where it is a tree of considerable
size. It is cultivated to some extent,
but in this state remains a shrub, and the
quality is finer. It may be gathered at
any season of the year, and the leaves
must become dry enough to pulverize
before they are fit for use.</p>
<p>Where it is cultivated it is dried in
metal pans, after the manner of Chinese
tea, but far greater quantities are gathered
in the forests and dried in the primitive
method adopted from the Indians.</p>
<p>A drying floor is prepared by clearing
a space of ground and pounding it hard
with a mallet. On this a fire is built, and
after the ground is well heated, it is
swept off clean and branches from the
neighboring forests spread upon it. Afterwards
they are placed upon a rude arbor
made of hurdles and a slow fire beneath
completes the drying process.</p>
<p>When quite brittle the leaves are
pounded in a mortar and reduced to
small particles, but not to a powder. The
preparation of it consists in placing a
small quantity of it in a vessel, with sugar
if desired, and adding a little cold
water. After a little while boiling water
is poured on and it is then ready for use.
As the leaf particles do not settle well,
it must be sipped through a tube. The
natives for steeping it used a calabash
gourd called mate, whence its common
name, mate yerba, or calabash plant.
These gourds are still often used, and are
convenient, as they have a handle. Cocoa-nut
shells, with handles of silver or
other metal, are also popular. A reed
or a metal tube, with a small perforated
bowl at the bottom is used to sip it
through. This is called a bombilla.</p>
<p>It is customary with the Spaniards
and Portuguese to offer mate to visitors.</p>
<p>In the gardens of that sunny region
vineclad arbors are furnished with seats,
where the family with their visitors will
sit in the cool of the evening, each one
supplied with a bombilla and a cocoa-nut
or calabash bowl of mate. Through a
small opening in the top of the vessel the
tube is inserted and the grateful infusion
is enjoyed while matters of interest are
discussed.</p>
<p>Great virtues are ascribed to this drink.
Its properties appear to be chiefly due to
theine and caffeine.</p>
<p>In Chili and Peru it is in universal
use, and is considered more necessary
than meat. On the plains of Argentina
the gaucho or cowboy washes down his
dried beef with copious draughts of mate
and is content with his meal. To northerners
the taste is not agreeable. It
seems weedy and slightly bitter. For
shipment the leaves, when dried, are
packed in oblong cases or bags made of
rawhide carefully sewed. These packages
contain 120 pounds each. Since
the beginning of the seventeenth century
this drink has been used in Paraguay,
and its use now extends all over South
America. It is estimated that the amount
used annually exceeds 60,000,000 pounds.</p>
<p>It is being introduced into other countries
and the time may come when the
bombilla and the bowl of mate may become
a rival of five o&rsquo;clock tea in English
and American parlors.</p>

<h2 id="c15">THE AMERICAN BUFFALO.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Bison americanus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The supremacy of man over the lower
forms of animal life has no better illustration
than that furnished by the rapid extermination
of the American Buffalo
(Bison or Bos americanus.)</p>
<p>Much less than a century ago, in immense
herds, this animal swarmed over
the prairies of the United States, unmolested
except by the Indians who sought
it for food and for the economic value
of its hide. It was free to seek those localities
which would furnish it the best
and most abundant food supply. Even as
late as the sixties of the last century the
American Buffalo was represented by
thousands upon thousands of individuals,
whose numerous paths leading from the
feeding grounds to a supply of fresh
water were known to the frontiersman
as &ldquo;Buffalo trails.&rdquo; &ldquo;In 1889 Mr. William
T. Hornaday estimated the number of
survivors to be eight hundred and thirty-five,
inclusive of the two hundred then
living in the Yellowstone Park under the
protection of the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passing from the face of the earth
of this, the largest of the native animals
of North America, has taken place within
the last thirty years and this extermination
may be laid at the door of the zealous
hunter and trapper who systematically
shot and destroyed them in order to obtain
the small profit that their skins would
bring. It is said that one of the railroads
crossing the continent from the Mississippi
river to the Pacific coast carried about
two hundred thousand skins within a year
after it was opened to traffic. One writer
records the reception of over forty thousand
pelts by a single firm in the year
1875. Many instances of the wanton
butchery of this noble and useful animal
might be mentioned, but it is much better
illustrated by the absence of the Buffalo
at the present time, from all localities, except
where it is protected by the same
hand which has brought about its destruction.
In 1858, when a party was traversing
the country by wagon train from
the state of Missouri to Mexico, they
were continually surrounded by large
herds of Buffaloes. An eye witness said,
&ldquo;In bands, in masses, in hosts, the
shaggy, black creatures thundered along
in front of us, sometimes from north to
south, sometimes from south to north;
for forty consecutive hours we had them
in sight, thousands upon thousands, tens
of thousands upon tens of thousands,
an innumerable mass of untamed animals,
the flesh of which, as we believed,
was sufficient to provide the wigwams
of the Indians unto all eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American Buffalo belongs to the
ox tribe of the family of horned animals
(Bovid&aelig;). Among its immediate relatives
are the musk ox of the Arctic regions
of America, the yak of the mountainous
regions of Tibet, the zebu, an East
Indian species, the Cape buffalo, a ferocious
animal of the central and southern
portions of Africa, the Indian buffalo living
in southern Asia and the European
bison.</p>
<p>The European bison, like its American
relative, has suffered from the hunter and
the advance of civilization and is practically
exterminated. It now exists only in
a few forests on the Caucasus and in the
famous forest and game preserve of the
Czars of Russia called Lithuania. Here,
protected by stringent laws through several
centuries, the European bison has
been saved from absolute extermination.
&ldquo;In former times this was different, for
the bison ranged all over Europe and a
large portion of Asia.&rdquo; In the time of
C&aelig;sar, according to his own record, they
abounded in Germany and Belgium.</p>
<p>So it is with the American Buffalo.
Were it not for government and private
preserves this, one of the largest of living
quadrupeds, would be unknown to future
generations except by museum specimens.
Correctly speaking, the American species
should be called Bison. So universal,
however, is the use of the term Buffalo
that the word Bison would puzzle many
people. Strictly speaking, the name buffalo
should be applied only to designate
the Cape and Indian species.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i1014.jpg" alt="" width="662" height="500" />
<p class="caption">AMERICAN BISON OR BUFFALO.
<br />(Bison americanus).</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The original range of the American
Buffalo extended from but little west of
the Atlantic coast westward to the Rocky
Mountains and from Mexico on the south
northward to about the sixty-fifth degree
of north latitude. By the trappers the Buffaloes
were placed in two classes. Those
that frequented the mountain ranges were
called Bison. They were seldom seen on
the plains, the home of the other class.
Their limbs were shorter and stouter and
better fitted for a rough country. There
existed in former ages two other species
entirely distinct from the animal with
which we are familiar. They were much
larger, possibly as large as an elephant,
and were probably associates of the mastodon
and the mammoth.</p>
<p>A fully adult male Buffalo will measure
about nine or ten feet in length from the
muzzle to the tail. Its height at the fore
quarters is from five to six and one-half
feet. The female is much smaller and
weighs from seven to eight hundred
pounds less than the male, the weight of
which averages eighteen hundred pounds.</p>
<p>The Buffalo&rsquo;s massive head, with its
short, curved horns which are set far
apart on the broad forehead, is connected
with the body by a short deep and narrow
neck. From the neck the body rises, forming
a large hump on the back over the
forelegs, which gives the animal an odd
and unwieldy appearance. This hump
consists of fat and strong muscles which
control the movements of the massive
head. From the hump the body tapers
downward so that the hind quarters are
low and narrow. The anterior portion of
the body, the forelegs and the head are
covered with long hair. On the forehead
and back the hair is curly and matted. In
the early spring most of the long hair is
shed, resulting in a modification of the
color of the Buffalo. The new coat is a
uniform grayish brown, deepening into
black-brown in the mane, which covers
the top part of the head, forehead, neck
and under surface of the throat.</p>
<p>Captain Doyle in an article published
in the American Naturalist says, &ldquo;White
Buffaloes have frequently been seen and
killed. All the Indian tribes regard them
as &lsquo;big medicine,&rsquo; but they have different
superstitions regarding them. For instance
Catlin, the painter, while among
the Mandans in 1832, saw a white buffalo
robe erected on a pole in their village
as a sacrifice to the Great Spirit. It
had been purchased from the Blackfeet,
who killed the Buffalo, for eight horses
and a quantity of goods. On the other
hand, the Comanches believe it very dangerous
to see a white Buffalo. In 1869 I
saw a young Comanche, who had seen a
white Buffalo, return to his camp almost
dead with fear. He was taken into his
tent, the medicine man was sent for and
they smoked him and kept up incantations
over him day and night for a week. When
he came out he believed that he had had a
very narrow escape from death. In 1859
a white Buffalo was killed by a white man
on the north fork of the Red river. He
desired to have it dressed to preserve it,
but failed to get any Indian to undertake
the task for a long time. At last he prevailed
on a Comanche chief, named
&lsquo;Horseback&rsquo; to have the operation performed.
&lsquo;Horseback&rsquo; selected one of his
squaws, had the medicine man of his band
go through various ceremonies over her
to preserve her life and then placed her in
a tepee some distance from his camp,
where the hide was taken to her by a soldier
and brought away by him when
dressed. No other Indian would look at
the hide, much less touch it. Her food
was left for her at some distance from the
tepee and when the robe was dressed,
medicine ceremonies were held over her
before she was allowed to join the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These gregarious animals, during the
period of their supremacy, rarely remained
for any great length of time in
any given locality. Frequently, as if
moved by a sudden and general impulse,
the whole herd, made up of many smaller
companies, each with its leader, would
start, all the individuals moving in the
same direction. No barriers seemed too
great to overcome. Moving in a straight
line they would swim or ford rivers, find
some means of crossing chasms, but still
move on as if led by some irresistible
impulse.</p>
<p>These migrations, in many instances,
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
may have been due to the necessity of
seeking a more plentiful supply of food,
especially when the pastures in the more
northern regions became covered with
snow. This caused them to move southward.
The northern tribes of Indians did
not believe that the same individuals returned,
as the climatic conditions permitted,
but that the Buffaloes were produced
in immense numbers under ground
and that in the spring they came forth
from a great mountain far to the south, a
herd of new individuals coming north
each season. Since the Buffaloes have
disappeared from the plains, some Indians
claim that the holes in the southern mountains,
in which the Buffaloes were formed,
have been closed by some evil spirit.</p>
<p>Dr. Brehm tells us that &ldquo;among the
Buffalo&rsquo;s perceptive senses those of smell
and hearing rank first. In its mental
qualities it does not differ from its other
relatives. It is little gifted, good-natured
and timid, incapable of rapid excitement,
but when it is irritated it is apt to forget
all considerations which generally influence
it and it will then oppose an enemy
with courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would seem that the Buffalo depends
upon the sense of smell rather than that
of sight, for when running from danger
it holds the muzzle near the ground and
rushes with incredible swiftness in the
opposite direction. Obstinacy is one of
the most marked characteristics of the
Buffalo. When once moved to a certain
action nothing seemed to sway a herd
from its decision. Boats on rivers have
been known to stop and wait for the
passing of a herd that was swimming
across the stream. Railroad trains have
also been brought to a standstill by the
herds crossing the tracks.</p>
<p>The American Buffalo was in reality
an inoffensive beast and its ferocious
appearance was due to its great bulk.
&ldquo;They are not intractable to domestication,
readily entering into friendly relations
with individuals who treat them
kindly; at least they learn to recognize
their keeper and to love him to a certain
degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years ago the Buffalo was the friend
of the American Indian. It furnished
him not only with food but its skin served
him as a blanket and as a covering for
his tepees. Its skin also provided the
leather from which he made his clothing
and footwear. At this time, as Moellhausen
has said, &ldquo;The Buffalo could, in a
certain sense, be considered a domestic
animal of the Indians, no diminution of
the innumerable herds could be noticed;
on the contrary, they throve and multiplied
on the rich pastures.&rdquo; Ever content
if all their wants were satisfied, the American
Indians killed only those that were
required for their present needs. It was
not till the white man visited them with
his stock of glittering trinkets, so attractive
to the red man, that he began to
kill indiscriminately. He learned that the
white man was pleased with their robes
and that the flesh of the Buffalo delighted
his taste; that he was willing to trade his
trinkets for robes and flesh. It was then
that the Indian&rsquo;s whole demeanor toward
the Buffalo changed and he became the
weak servant of the trader, bartering the
lives of thousands of noble animals for
valueless things which pleased his eye or
caught his fancy.</p>
<p>The value of the Buffalo to the Indian&rsquo;s
welfare can be shown in no better way
than by quoting the words of Captain
Butler. &ldquo;&lsquo;What shall we do?&rsquo; said a
young Sioux warrior to an American officer
on the Upper Missouri. &lsquo;What shall
we do? The Buffalo is our only friend.
When he goes, all is over with the red
man. I speak thus to you because, like
me, you are a brave.&rsquo; It was little wonder
that he called the Buffalo his only friend.
Its skin gave him a house, its robe a
blanket and a bed, its undressed hide a
boat, its short, curved horn a powder-flask,
its meat his daily food, its sinew a string
for his bow, its leather a lariat for his
horse, a saddle, bridle, rein and bit. Its
tail formed an ornament for his tent, its
inner skin a book on which to sketch the
brave deeds of his life, the medicine robe
of his history. House, boat, food, bed
and covering, every want from infancy to
age and after life had passed; wrapped in
his Buffalo robe the red man waited for
the dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c16">MR. CHAT, THE PUNCHINELLO.
<br /><span class="small">A TRUE STORY.</span></h2>
<p>If Mr. Chat were an ordinary performer
he would doubtless select a spot
in the center of the village square;
he would put up his little stage and his
drop-curtain and would send small boys
all through the village with his flaming
posters:</p>
<p class="center">ATTENTION, EVERY ONE!
<br />This Afternoon&mdash;in the Village Square
<br /><span class="sc">At Two O&rsquo;clock</span>,
<br />Mr. Yellow-Breasted Chat will give one of his
<br />REMARKABLE PERFORMANCES</p>
<p>Mr. Chat is acknowledged by all to
be the best imitator, the most gifted
singer, the finest elocutionist, the cleverest
ventriloquist, the greatest athlete
in all bird-dom.</p>
<p class="center">MR. CHAT
<br /><span class="sc">Orator, Singer, Gymnast and Punchinello!</span>
<br />Don&rsquo;t fail to see him!</p>
<p>and by two o&rsquo;clock the village square
would be alive with people, and after
the show the dimes would rattle into
the hat and no one would go away disappointed,
as Mr. Chat&rsquo;s poster would be
nearer the truth than most posters of
its kind.</p>
<p>All this if Mr. Chat were an ordinary
performer, but he is not. His performance
is so far ahead of anything that
was ever advertised on a poster, that
there are not dimes enough in all the
world to buy it. You may set a day
for him and invite all your friends, or
you may take your friends and go seek
him in his own haunts; you may try to
coax, hire, threaten; you may do everything
in your power; but Mr. Chat is a
happy creature of inspiration, and makes
dates with nobody.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When he will, he will&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">You may depend on&rsquo;t;</p>
<p class="t0">And when he won&rsquo;t, he won&rsquo;t&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">And there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t!</p>
</div>
<p>His only tent is the blue sky; his
stage-setting a jungle of trees near a
swamp; his stage a thick bough near
the top of a tree; his curtain the leaves
of a white birch, or willow, or butternut;
his orchestra and curtain-raiser the wind,
and his audience his wife sitting patiently
on the eggs in her nest, and&mdash;you,
if you belong to Nature&rsquo;s elect and
happen to be near the swamp at that
moment and have the kind of eyes that
really see and the kind of ears that
really hear. Mrs. Chat can command
the performance with one little bird
sigh. You could not buy it with the
wealth of the world. After the entertainment
is over, Mr. Chat drives his
wife from the nest and takes her place
on the eggs while she flies out over the
tree-tops for a little outing. Not many
bird husbands are so considerate.</p>
<p>Once upon a time (you see the story
is just beginning now) I happened to
find myself in a pasture; not a tame,
every-day, green pasture tacked on one
end of a nice smooth farm&mdash;not at all!
but a pasture on top of a high hill, with
beautiful fields stretching out below it,
and all pink and white with laurel. The
cows, who, they say, do not care either
for laurel or scenery, may not have
liked this pasture, but I did. So when
I had climbed the bars and seated myself
on the top one to view the country,
I saw at the far edge of the pasture, a
jungle of trees, and I liked it still more,
and determined to explore it. On the
way I flushed a brown thrasher in a
laurel bush, and he flew into the jungle.
There seemed to be but one bird singing
in all the neighborhood, and this
song which was a peculiar one, lured
me into the thicket. On I went very
cautiously till the sound seemed to
be directly overhead. I paused and
listened and peered into the tree tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caw-caw!&rdquo; cried the bird harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but an old crow,&rdquo; said I in
disgust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>I started to go, when from the same
spot overhead came a loud, clear double
note, and again I waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow! meow!&rdquo; remarked my new
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
might have known it was Mr. Catbird.&rdquo;
But immediately there came a glorious
trill&mdash;first over my head, then
almost under my feet, then at my
right hand, then at my left; though
there was no flutter of wings or other
sound in all the jungle. At last the
fallen branch upon which I had been
sitting gave way and I went into the
swamp with a splash of mud. &ldquo;Look
out, look out!&rdquo; came a sarcastic voice
from the tree top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an escaped Poll-parrot,&rdquo; said I,
to reassure myself, but I took out my
handkerchief and mopped my heated
brow. The unknown then proceeded
to bark like a dog, quack like a duck,
and squeal like a pig, with occasionally
a measure of song in between. At last
in desperation I seized a young sapling
near at hand and shook it with all my
might, thinking to frighten him into
showing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw-haw-haw!&rdquo; rang out clearly
from the top of the very sapling itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no bird,&rdquo; I announced to the
swamp; &ldquo;it is an imp of the forest trying
to lure me to destruction in the
jungle,&rdquo; and I turned and fled.</p>
<p>I felt better when I met a cotton-tail
rabbit, though he did not stop to be
greeted; and still better when I reached
the sunlight and the pink and white
laurel pasture; and when I neared the
bars and saw my horse grazing patiently
on the other side, I was quite
myself again. On an upright stake at
the side of the bars sat a strange, yellowish
bird. I did not know him, for I
had not so many bird friends then as I
have now. Suddenly he rose in the air
with a shriek, his legs dangling helplessly.
&ldquo;Is this a magical pasture,&rdquo; I
said to myself, &ldquo;where birds are shot
without the report of a gun?&rdquo; and then
with legs still dangling, he made a
beautiful gyration in the air, and calling
out: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;tut&mdash;tut&mdash;tut!&rdquo;
disappeared in the direction of
the thicket. This was my first attendance
upon one of the remarkable performances
of Mr. Yellow-Breasted Chat,
and I can without hesitation pronounce
it the most wonderful in all bird-dom.</p>
<p>The next day I invited some skeptical
friends to prove the truth of my
story. So at the same time of day we
drove up the long hills till we spied the
pink and white of the laurel, and halted
at the gray bars. The pasture which
had been deserted the day before, was
now spotted with cows, the laurel had
begun to fade, and though we waited
one long, weary hour, not a sight or
sound of a bird of any description did
we see. The towhee and the shore lark
whom I had seen the day before,
seemed to have dropped out of existence,
and those disagreeable people
hinted that even the brown thrasher
was a myth. But as I ventured alone
into the dark swamp, hoping still to
stir up Mr. Chat, I came face to face
with the beautiful purple-fringed orchis&mdash;the
large, early variety&mdash;blooming
alone in the damp thicket, so straight
and stately, and of such a delicate, refined
beauty, I fell on my knees beside
it, and felt it to be ample compensation
for any disappointments. So you see
it is true that there is not wealth enough
in all the world to force a bird-song at
the moment when you want it, but at
the same time and in the same swamp
the purple orchis may be blooming for
you.</p>

<h2 id="c17">AGATE.</h2>
<p>Agate is a form of the common mineral
quartz. From other forms of that
mineral it differs in being made up of
minute layers and in being variegated in
color. The colors may appear in the
form of bands or clouds. The banded
agates appear to be made up of parallel
layers, sometimes straight, but more often
wavy or curved in outline. These
layers or bands differ in color from one
another, exhibiting shades of white, gray,
blue, yellow, red, brown or black. To
the naked eye they appear to vary in
width from the finest lines to a width of
a quarter of an inch or more. In reality,
all the bands visible to the naked eye are
made up of finer ones, to be seen only
with the microscope. Thus in a single
inch of thickness of agate Sir David
Brewster, using the microscope, counted
seventeen thousand and fifty layers. Besides
differing in color, the layers differ
in transparency and porosity, and these
properties add to the variegated appearance
of the agate.</p>
<p>On account of their beauties of color
and outline, agates have been known and
prized from the earliest times. They are
mentioned by many of the ancient Greek
writers, and the name agate is a corruption
of the name Achates, a river in
Sicily, whence the first stones of this kind
used by the Greeks were obtained. This
and neighboring localities continued to
be the source of supply until the fifteenth
century, when agates were found to occur
in large quantities near Oberstein and
Idar on the banks of the river Nahe, in
the duchy of Oldenburg.</p>
<p>The industry of cutting and polishing
the agates on a large scale was soon established
there, and these places are to
this day the center of the agate industry.
The agates used most extensively at the
present time are not, however, those
found about Oberstein, but come from a
region about one hundred miles in length
extending from the Province of Rio
Grande do Sul, of Southern Brazil, into
Northern Uruguay.</p>
<p>The agates in this region, first discovered
in 1827, so surpass in size and
beauty those from any other known locality,
that they form at the present time
almost the only source of supply. They
are shipped in large quantities as ballast
to Oberstein and Idar, and here the work
of cutting, polishing and coloring them is
performed. The discovery that the attractiveness
of agates could be enhanced
by artificial coloring was made about the
beginning of the nineteenth century. The
natural colors are rarely of a high order,
being often only variations of white and
gray or dull yellows and reds. Through
the difference of porosity of the different
layers, however, and the consequent different
absorption of coloring ingredients,
methods of artificial coloring can be employed,
which produce lasting and pleasing
effects. Most agate used for ornamental
purposes at the present time is
therefore artificially colored.</p>
<p>Agates of considerable beauty, though
not of great size, are found in many
places in the United States. Those of
Agate Bay, Lake Superior, have rich
colors and make attractive charms and
other ornaments. Agates are found in
the beds of many streams in Colorado,
Montana and other regions of the Rocky
Mountains. They occur all along the
Mississippi River, especially in Minnesota,
also along the Fox River, Illinois, in
the trap rocks along the Connecticut
River, and on the coast of California.
While many of these agates are of great
beauty, their use and sale is not likely
to be anything more than local, since the
Brazilian agates can be supplied so cheaply
from Germany. The moss agates of
Colorado and other localities in the
Rocky Mountains are, however, equal to
anything in the world.</p>
<p>The layered structure of agates is due
to successive depositions of silica by water
flowing through cavities in rocks.
Rising and falling alternately through
the rocks the water leaves a mark of each
advance or retreat in the form of an additional
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
layer deposited upon the interior
walls of the cavity. Agates, therefore,
grow from the outside inward. The process
may go on until the cavity is entirely
filled or may cease at any time. If water
remains in the cavity for some time crystals,
such as are sometimes seen, will be
formed. The nodule of silica or agate
formed by the percolating waters is harder
and more resistant than the surrounding
rock. Hence it remains after the
surrounding rock has been worn away.
We can thus understand why agates
should be found, as they usually are, on
sea or lake beaches, or in the beds of
streams.</p>
<p>The different colors seen in the natural
agates are produced by traces of organic
matter or of oxides of iron, manganese
or titanium contained in the waters
which formed them.</p>
<p>The beautiful moss-like inclusions seen
in the moss agates are due to a partial
crystallization of oxide of manganese or
iron contained in the waters. The particles
of oxide in these cases arrange
themselves in arborescent forms, just as
do the particles of frost crystallizing on a
window pane.</p>
<p>Agates are not used as extensively as
they once were for ornamental purposes.
In the years of 1848-50 agate jewelry was
very fashionable and was extensively
worn. At the present time, however, the
principal use of agate in jewelry is for
breastpins and watch charms. For ornamental
purposes it is used in pen-holders,
knife handles, and vases. Its use
for large marbles was once quite common,
but glass marbles of the same size
and still called &ldquo;agates&rdquo; are now generally
substituted. In fine mechanical
work, such as bearings for delicate instruments
and in tools for polishing and
grinding, agate is still extensively used.</p>

<h2 id="c19">A PANSY BED.</h2>
<p>There is ever so much fun in a pansy
bed. If you have never had one, ask your
papa or mamma to let you have one this
summer. A few dozen plants will give you
much pleasure.</p>
<p>There are so many little faces to know
among them, and so many little family
groups. Some grin at you like monkeys,
others scowl, some seem to wink, some
smile shyly, while others are curious and
open-eyed. There is a white family delicately
blue-veined&mdash;Colonial Dames, I
call them. There are negroes of the darkest
hue, Indians, and those that the sun
seems to have bronzed. There are groups
of Chinamen with their little &ldquo;yellow
kids.&rdquo; Some are tattooed, and some have
striped skin. Many wear ruffled bonnets,
and some have beards. The little clusters
are so erect and alert on a morning after a
heavy dew that they seem like families off
for an outing or school children waiting
for a snap shot. There are lovely grandmothers
wearing purple caps with white
frills, and with faces though crinkled and
wrinkled yet full of smiles and wisdom.
There are sweethearts too, their
little heads close together, and they whisper,
whisper when the wind goes by.</p>
<p>What do you think? One day from out
of my bowl of pansies which I had placed
on the lunch table skipped two frisky
&ldquo;yellow kids.&rdquo; I discovered them hand in
hand skipping away. Their little figures
were reflected in the polished surface of
the table, and they seemed partners out
of a Virginia reel. As I put them back in
the bowl among their elders, I felt that I
had wantonly interrupted a runaway.</p>
<p>Watch how the pansies love the rain!
As they seem praying for it with bent
heads in dry weather, so they seem
a-quiver with thanksgiving after a
shower.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do with
your pansies. First, though, you must
love them. You must teach pussy and the
dog not to tramp over them. Every day
you must take off all the faded flowers.
You must water them and weed them.
You will enjoy gathering a bouquet daily
for the house, and if anybody is ill, papa
or mamma or some one else you love, by
all means carry them a bunch of your
pansies.</p>
<p>In midsummer, when the fairies have
pitched their tents about the sweet-scented
bed, the blossoms will have become so
many that if grandpa or grandma has a
birthday, you can gather seventy or eighty
(possibly ninety if you need so many) for
a birthday gift. You will not see the fairies
about the bed, for they come at midnight,
but the dew-sprinkled tents are
there, and the cluster of toadstools that
the brownies like so well.</p>
<p>Do not forget to give some flowers to
the poor children who stand outside your
gate, and who wish for some for their
very own. The children who have no
garden love to look at yours.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have an older sister or
brother who paints. If so, they may like
some of your pansies to sketch, and to
keep in the house in the winter when your
real ones are tucked under the earth and
snow.</p>
<p>You will find several live things in your
flower bed; the bees, the butterflies, and
once in a while a humming-bird. Sir
Bumble, the bee who looks so heavy and
clumsy, touches lightly the pansies, and
the pansies like to have him about, for he
is so lively and cheery, so do not drive
him away. The light yellow and the deep
yellow butterflies seem like the pansies
themselves, flying off from their stems for
a journey about the country. Who knows
what the butterflies and the bees tell the
flowers, or what messages the flowers
send by the flying creatures that pay
them visits? When you have pansy
beds of your own perhaps you will be
able to write me some stories, and then
perhaps you can tell me what the butterflies,
bees and pansies talk about.</p>

<h2 id="c20">THE MULLEN.</h2>
<p>Most of the familiar or useful plants
have had their origin or characteristics
accounted for by myths or legends,
whereby the ignorant and superstitious
have attempted to explain such features
as attracted their attention. Some of
these ideas were creditable to the plant,
while others were quite the contrary. The
Mullen appears to have led a dual existence,
seeking an alliance with the spiritual
world and at the same time aiding and
abetting the witches in their nefarious undertakings.</p>
<p>A very pretty story concerning the
Mullen is attributed to the American Indian,
but in some regards it seems to be a
variant of the Scandinavian Tree of Life
myth. It appears that the Great Spirit
of the red men lived at the top of a high
tree whose branches reached to the heavens;
as no mortal could attain to this high
attitude, a spirit of the woods, in the guise
of a beautiful maiden, took pity upon the
people and so fashioning a ladder from
the stems of the wild grape vine, she fastened
it to a star. In order that the Great
Father might not be disturbed, the fair
sylvan carpeted the steps of the ladder
with the velvet leaves of the Mullen, upon
which she noiselessly ascended and descended,
bearing the petitions of the red
men or bringing to them advice or admonitions.</p>
<p>Of the one hundred and twenty-five
species of Mullen that are native to the
old world, five have become naturalized in
the United States. The Great Mullen
(Verbascum thapsus), so familiar in dry,
open fields, was originally christened by
Pliny and has since received over forty
English names of a less classical origin
and significance. The name Verbascum
is supposed to be derived from Berbascum,
meaning a beard. Pliny doubtless
selected this name, either because of the
hairs on the stems of the plants or on
account of the silky character of the
leaves. The specific name, thapsus, is said
to have been added, as the plants grew in
considerable numbers in the vicinity of
Thapsus.</p>
<p>One of the significant but impracticable
common names of the Great Mullen is
Hag-taper. The plant gained this unpleasant
appellation by reason of the fact
that if any one steps on a young Mullen
plant after sundown, the witches will ride
him as a horse until morning, lighting the
way with Mullen stalks used for torches.
These torches were also employed at the
meetings of the hags and witches, when
the leaves of the plant were an important
element in the concoctions prepared in
their cauldrons. Another name is Hare&rsquo;s
Beard, illustrating a class of plants that
have weird names because of some fancied
likeness to animals. The name Cow&rsquo;s
Lungwort, arose from the resemblance between
the leaf and the dewlap of a cow,
from which it was argued that the plant
must be a specific for lung diseases. In
England, where the Mullen is known as
Blanket Leaf, the dried leaf is tied around
the throat in cases of colds. It is believed
that the leaf sets up a mild irritation which
will be beneficial. The dried stalks of the
plants were often used for torches at funerals
which gave rise to the names High
or Hedge Torch. The Great Mullen
varies in height from two to seven feet.
The stem is stout, very woolly, with
branching hairs. The oblong, pale green,
velvety leaves form a rosette on the
ground or alternately clasp the stem. The
flowers, which are about an inch in
diameter, are clustered around a thick,
dense spike, and have two long and three
short stamens, so arranged as to materially
assist the process of cross fertilization
which is largely carried on by bees.
It is interesting to note in connection with
the thick woolly covering of the plant
that many vegetable forms are so protected
when exposed to intense heat or
cold. This is true of most alpine and
desert forms and the value of such a protection
to the Mullen will be seen when
it is remembered that the plants are always
found in open, dry, stony fields exposed
to the fierce heat of the sun, and
afforded no protection for the rosettes
of year-old plants which must survive the
winter in order to send up the flower
stalk the second spring.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The Moth Mullen (Verbascum blattaria)
is a far more attractive and graceful
plant than the form previously described.
The specific name was derived
from the idea that the plant would kill the
cockroach (Blatta). It was supposed
that moths would not go near the plant,
and it was quite a general custom in New
England to pack these plants or flowers
with clothing or furs in order to keep out
moths. The stamens are similar to those
of the Great Mullen, except the filaments
are tufted with violet hairs. The flowers
are yellow or white on long, loose racemes.
The erect, slender stem is usually
about two feet in height, and as a rule
there are no leaves present at the flowering
time.</p>

<h2 id="c22">JIM CROW AND HIS COUSINS.</h2>
<p>While much can be said about the
beauty and grace of birds of brilliant
plumage and those of soul-stirring song,
there is as much to be written concerning
those noted for their sagacity and
cunning. Some have selected the parrot
as the model in this particular and
the choice is not a mistake.</p>
<p>There is, however, a tribe which all
may observe more or less, while a story
relating to their habits or pranks will
ever find willing listeners. The Crow is
the best known of this genus, and
grouped with him are the chough, the
raven, the rook and the jackdaw. All
of these may be tamed, and afterward
may be taught to use the language of
man.</p>
<p>The plumage of the Crow in the northern
parts of the world is black, and we
are so accustomed to that color that to
speak of a white or of a spotted Crow
might subject one to ridicule, yet in
many parts of the world such Crows are
found. Some are gray and black, and
some species are larger than others. They
are characterized by a comparatively
short tail, long wings, and a strong,
rather conical beak.</p>
<p>Crows are distinguished from ravens
by their smaller size, and by the feathers
of the neck blending with those of
the body, while on the ravens, the neck
feathers are pointed and distinct. The
Crow family is widely distributed, but
Crows, as properly understood, are mainly
inhabitants of the north temperate
zone. They are intelligent, wary birds
(when persecuted), and are practically
omnivorous, feeding upon fish, fowl,
eggs, snakes, frogs, crabs, shell-fish,
grubs, fruits, seeds and berries. The
common Crow of North America is particularly
abundant in the Eastern United
States, and is looked upon as the inveterate
foe of the farmer on account of the
amount of injury he inflicts on growing
crops, and especially upon corn. There
is, however, a credit side to the account
in the destruction of grubs; but as the
Crow is by nature such a pilferer, he
must be regarded as harmful in many
ways.</p>
<p>In the fall and winter these glossy
birds assemble by thousands in great
roosts, or rookeries; one of these roosts
on the Potomac above Washington has
been estimated to harbor 40,000 Crows,
while others are still larger. In the gray
of the morning the birds leave in clamorous
crowds for their feeding-grounds,
often many miles away, and in the afternoon
may be seen winging their way
homeward in long lines, high above the
earth in fair weather, low down in foul.
The eastern fish crow, frequently found
in company with the others, is a smaller
bird, and can readily be distinguished
by its hoarse caw.</p>
<p>The Carrion Crow of Europe and Asia
closely resembles the North American
Crow in form, size and habits, but is perhaps
a little more destructive, attacking
and killing lambs, or even weakly sheep.
The Hooded Crow, found in northern
and eastern Europe and in many parts of
Asia, is gray, with black head, throat,
wings and tail. The Gray-necked Crow
of India is a small but bold and mischievous
species, often stealing the very food
from the table. On the other hand, it
does much good as a scavenger, forming
an able adjunct to the vultures in this
respect.</p>
<p>An interesting story is told of a Crow
of this species which had been tamed
and petted until it behaved much as
would a spoiled child. &ldquo;Old Crusty,&rdquo;
as he was called, would actually take the
food away from the dog while he was
eating, not by open encounter, for that
would have deprived him of his fun.
But he would tease the poor canine until
he barked from vexation, then snatch
up the prey and triumphantly bear it off
to a neighboring tree, where he ate it at
his leisure, while the dog stood looking
at him and uselessly venting his rage in
loud, threatening barks.</p>
<p>The annual &ldquo;muster&rdquo; of the Crows,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
like that of blackbirds, is a scene very
amusing, as well as mysterious. It has
been my privilege to witness a few such
gatherings, but to me there seemed more
noise than meaning. It is said by naturalists,
however, that the most extraordinary
meetings of the Crows occur in
northern Scotland. There they collect
in great numbers, as if they had all been
summoned for the occasion; a few of
the flock sit with drooping heads, and
others seem grave as judges, while others
again are exceedingly active and
noisy. One authority says: &ldquo;These
meetings will sometimes continue for a
day or so before the object, whatever it
may be, is completed. Crows continue
to arrive from all quarters during the
session. As soon as all have arrived a
very general noise ensues, and shortly
after the whole fall upon one or two individuals
and put them to death. When
the execution has been performed they
quietly disperse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chough is a red-legged Crow and
is one of the most mischievous birds of
his genus. He carefully examines everything
he finds, then carries it away if he
can. And if there be a collection of anything
to which he has access, he is sure
to scatter it in all directions. Those
which have been converted into pets have
proven very affectionate, but they are
easily offended and will often vent their
spite in a most annoying yet very amusing
manner.</p>
<p>The Raven is very much like the Crow
in his habits, but is more given to fighting
and to burglary than his shy cousin.
He is a great tease, also, and will often
attack children and even grown up people
just for fun. By this it can be seen
that the Raven is more susceptible to
taming than the Crow, while no old Crow
can steal so many articles or hide them
as completely as the Raven. They are
quick to make friends with dog or man,
but, like the Chough, are very troublesome
foes when once offended.</p>
<p>The Rook is a European bird, and
though the farmer recognizes in him a
destroyer of his young crops, he must
admit that without the Rook he would
save little or none of his crop. Worms
constitute the favorite food of this bird,
wherefore many a husbandman has
learned that it is best to endure the disadvantages
of a rookery merely for the
sake of his harvests. For one queer
habit of Rooks is that they will frequent
the same spot all their lives, and it is
next to impossible to dislodge them from
their abode.</p>
<p>The Jackdaws are the boldest of the
genus, and have a very remarkable
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; look. They frequent high
towers, hollow trees, and even appropriate
to their own use the loftiest parts of
the English castles. They choose their
mates for life, and do not live in communities.
They assemble in flocks, however,
when cherries begin to ripen and
will soon rob a tree if the owner is not
on guard.</p>
<p>An amusing story is told of a tame
Jackdaw. While pilfering one day he
found a half-glass of whisky which had
been left upon a table, and on tasting it,
he liked it so much that he drank a quantity.
In a few moments symptoms of intoxication
began to appear; his wings
dropped and his eyes were half-closed.
He staggered towards the edge of the
table, probably intending to fly to the
floor, but he had either lost the power of
his wings or he was afraid to trust them.
He stood, seemingly meditating what
he should do, all the while reeling like
a drunken man about to lose his balance.
Presently his eyes were shut and
he fell over on his back with his legs in
the air, exhibiting every sign of death.</p>
<p>An attempt was made to put some
water down his throat, but he could not
swallow it. He was then rolled in a
piece of flannel, laid in a box and locked
away in a closet. All the family, with
whom he was a great pet, never expected
to see him on his legs again. Next
morning about six o&rsquo;clock the door was
opened, with the expectation of finding
Jackie dead, but he had freed himself
from the flannel and as soon as the door
was open he flew out and hurried away
to a basin-shaped stone, out of which the
fowls drank, and copiously allayed his
thirst. He repeated this several times
that day and was none the worse for his
exploit, but, with more forbearance than
those who are endowed with reason, he
never again would touch whisky.</p>

<p>The cocoa-yielding plant is a tree varying
from fifteen to forty feet in height.
The main stem or trunk is much twisted
and knotty, from which the branches
stand out almost horizontally. The bark
is thick, rough and of a cinnamon brown
color. The leaves are alternate, large,
smooth, entire, and of a deep green color.
Flowers occur singly, more usually in
clusters, from those parts of the branches
and trunk formerly corresponding to the
axils of leaves. Calyx deeply five-cleft,
pale red. Petals pink. Fruit solitary
or several together, pendulous, large,
pear-shaped; each pericarp enclosing
numerous brown seeds about the size of
a hickory nut or almond, from which
the chocolate and cocoa are made.</p>
<p>The chocolate tree is a native of Mexico,
Central America, Brazil and other
South American countries. It is now
extensively cultivated in most tropical
countries of both hemispheres. The
West Indian islands have numerous
large plantations. It is also found in
botanic gardens and greenhouses. There
are several cultivation varieties.</p>
<p>The cocoa or cacao yielding plant must
not be confounded with the coco-nut
palm or the coca-yielding plant which
has already been described.</p>
<p>The natives of Mexico used cocoa before
the discovery of America by Columbus.
The Toltecs cultivated the plant
centuries before they were finally conquered
by the more powerful and more
progressive Aztecs in 1325. Cortez and
Fernandez in their letters to Charles V.
of Spain referred to the cultivation of
cocoa by the Mexicans who used the
seeds not only as a food but also as a
medium of barter and exchange. It was
apparently the only medium accepted in
the payment of provincial taxes. Humboldt
states that cocoa was similarly employed
in Costa Rica and other Central
American countries.</p>
<p>In remote times cocoa was somewhat
differently prepared from what it is at
the present time. The roasted and
hulled seeds were coarsely pulverized in
a stone mortar, strongly spiced by means
of vanilla and other spices, boiled in
water and when cold stirred to a frothy
semi-liquid in cold water and eaten cold.
The word chocolate is said to be derived
from the Aztec <i>chocolatl</i> (<i>choca</i>, frothy
and <i>atl</i>, water). Through Cortez and
others who lauded very highly the value
of cocoa as a nourishing food for those
going on long journeys, it soon became
widely known. In 1520 considerable
quantities of it, pressed into cakes, were
shipped to Spain. Remarkable as it may
seem, it is stated that the Brazilians
learned the use of cocoa from the Spaniards.
The noted Italian traveler Carletti
(1597-1606) introduced the use and
preparation of cocoa into his native city,
Florence. Not all Europeans gave favorable
reports concerning the use of cocoa.
Clusius stated that it was more suited to
hogs than human beings. Acosta stated
that the drink had &ldquo;a nauseous aspect
and caused heart troubles.&rdquo; Cocoa was
introduced into France about 1615, England
about 1667, Germany about 1679.
Somewhat later chocolate houses were
established in various cities of Europe.
William Homburg, a chemist, of Paris,
extracted the fat from cocoa as early as
1695, and Quelus (1719) recommended
its use as a salve and as an article of
diet.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The fruit of the wild growing plants
is small and the seeds exceedingly bitter,
hence the cultivated cocoa is preferred.
The seeds are prepared in two ways, fermented
and unfermented. In the former
the seeds are placed in heaps in holes in
the earth, in boxes or barrels, covered
with leaves. In the course of four or
five days they begin to &ldquo;sweat&rdquo; or undergo
a mild form of fermentation. During
this time the seeds must be stirred about
occasionally. At the close of the sweating
process most of the bitterness is gone
and they have lost about one-half in
weight. Afterwards the seeds are rapidly
dried in the sun or in ovens. The
fully dried seeds have a rich brown color.
The following are the more important
market varieties of fermented cocoa:</p>
<p>1. Mexican or Soconusco Cocoa.&mdash;Seeds
rather small, delicate flavor and of
a golden yellow color. Since Mexico
does not produce sufficient cocoa for
home consumption this variety is rarely
exported. This and the following varieties
are said to be derived from Theobroma
bicolor, Th. angustifolium and Th.
ovalifolium.</p>
<p>2. Esmeralda Cocoa.&mdash;Similar to the
Mexican; somewhat darker in color.</p>
<p>3. Guatemala Cocoa.&mdash;Seeds large,
with mild flavor.</p>
<p>4. Caracas Cocoa.&mdash;From Venezuela.
Color pale brown, with a mild, agreeable
flavor. Usually coated with a film
of soil due to their being buried in the
earth during the sweating process. A
very highly priced variety.</p>
<p>5. Guayaquil Cocoa.&mdash;From Ecuador.
Seeds flattened, somewhat wedge-shaped,
wrinkled, reddish brown. An excellent
variety.</p>
<p>6. Berbice Cocoa.&mdash;From British
Guiana. Seeds small, externally gray,
internally reddish brown.</p>
<p>7. Surinam and Essequibo Cocoa.&mdash;Seeds
rather large and more firm; externally
a loamy gray, internally deep
reddish brown. Taste somewhat bitter.</p>
<p>The unfermented cocoa, also known as
sun cocoa and island cocoa, is dried rapidly
without fermenting. It is of a beautiful
reddish brown color and a bitter
astringent taste. The following are the
principal varieties:</p>
<p>1. Brazilian (Para, Bahia) Cocoa.&mdash;Seeds
smooth, wedge-shaped, flattened.
One edge nearly straight, the other convex.</p>
<p>2. Cayenne Cocoa.&mdash;Quite hard, externally
grayish brown, internally purplish
red.</p>
<p>3. Antilles Cocoa (Island Cocoa).&mdash;Of
this there are the following varieties:
a, Trinidad cocoa, with large, flat,
almost black brown seeds; b, Martinique
cocoa, with elongated, flattened, reddish
brown seeds; c, St. Domingo cocoa, with
small, flattened, dark purplish brown
seeds.</p>
<p>Cocoa requires considerable care in
cultivation. A moist atmosphere and
uniform temperature of about 24 to 28
degrees C., with considerable shade, is
best suited. The tall variety of banana
and the tree-like Erythrina Corallodendron
are the more common shade plants.
The plants are grown from seeds which
begin to germinate in eight days. The
trees begin to bear fruit in about four
years. More usually eight to ten years
elapse before any considerable fruit is
borne. Two crops are collected annually.
It is stated that there is on an average
only one fruit to every 3,000 flowers.</p>
<p>Chocolate and cocoa are prepared by
roasting the seeds, removing the husks
and crushing between hot rollers, which
liquefies the solid fat and forms a paste.
To make chocolate sugar is added and
flavored with vanilla and cinnamon.
Sometimes a coloring substance is added.
The paste is finally moulded into cakes
varying in size and form. Chocolate is
frequently adulterated with lard, starches,
rice flour and other substances. Cheap
grades are usually flavored with sassafras
nuts, cloves and other spices. In
the manufacture of cocoa the husks are
usually included and mixed with a variable
quantity of sugar, starch, flavoring
substances, etc. The roasted, hulled and
coarsely broken seeds are known as cocoa
nibs, and this is the purest kind of
cocoa. The powder made from the seeds
after the oil has been thoroughly expressed
is known as broma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The seeds contain about 50 per cent
of fat. In the manufacture of broma
and common cocoa most of this is removed
and is placed upon the market
as cocoa butter. The more or less broken
hulls are sold as cocoa shells, from which
a chocolate-like drink is made by boiling
in water and sweetening with sugar.</p>
<p>There is perhaps no food substance
which is more universally liked than
chocolate. Mothers have no small amount
of trouble in hiding the household chocolate
from the children. With the omnipresent
penny-in-the-slot machine more
pennies are credited to it than to the
chewing gum. The housewife and baker
use it very extensively with chocolate
cake. The confectioner uses it very
freely, to the great delight of children.</p>
<p>The principal use to which cocoa is
put is in the preparation of a beverage.
For this purpose enormous quantities of
chocolate, cocoa, broma and hulls are
consumed annually. The word &ldquo;Theobroma&rdquo;
is derived from the Greek, meaning
drink for the gods. The drink is
prepared by thoroughly triturating the
desired amount of chocolate, cocoa or
broma with a small quantity of water,
then stirring this into the necessary
quantity of boiling milk or water and
boiling for a few minutes with constant
stirring. The oil present gives the drink
great nutritive value. It is also slightly
stimulating, owing to the presence of an
alkaloid theobromine which is closely
similar in its properties to theine and
caffeine, the active constituents of tea and
coffee. The drink does not agree with
some individuals, because the large
amount of oil present causes indigestion.
It is also highly probable that the indigestion
or dyspepsia is due to the minute
fragments of roasted cell-walls of the
seeds, which are not only indigestible,
but irritate the secreting mucous cells
lining the inner surface of the stomach.</p>
<p>Cocoa butter, which resembles tallow
in consistency and appearance, is used
in medical and pharmaceutical practice
as a salve, or pomade, for external application
in eruptive diseases, as scarlet
fever, etc., etc. Cocoa also finds extensive
use in medical practice, though it
has no marked curative properties. Cocoa
from which the oil has been thoroughly
expressed (broma) makes an
excellent drink for convalescents. It is
used to disguise the taste of disagreeable
medicines, etc.</p>
